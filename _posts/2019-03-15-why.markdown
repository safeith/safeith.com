__Why I started this blog?__  
I started this blog because I want to write about new things I learn those and I'm going to keep those for others and myself.

__Why I use Jekyll?__  
Because it's easy to manage, and another side it uses markdown, and I like markdown.

__Why I use GitHub?__  
Because it lets me track my changes quickly, and It has GitHub pages that allow me to serve my Jekyll over it.
